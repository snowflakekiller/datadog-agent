    Add options to avoid some kind of payload from being sent to Datadog
    For some user, basic information gathered by a check can be too sensitive
    to be sent to Datadog (ex: IP addresses in events or service_check). We
    now have options to blacklist any kind of payload from being sent to the
    backend.
